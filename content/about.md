# About elm-conf

elm-conf is a single-day, one-track conference for the Elm programming language community, now in its third year.
Thank you to everyone who helps make elm-conf US a reality: speakers, attendees, the talk selection committee, and our sponsors.

Special thanks to [the Strange Loop team](http://www.thestrangeloop.com) for providing our venue.
It wouldn't have been possible without you!

## General organizing principles:

1. We assume you know about Elm already.
   Beginner talks, while great, are more appropriate for a general-interest conference.

2. A thriving community is built on diversity.
   We encourage people from all different backgrounds and walks of life to attend and speak.
   To ensure that all are welcome, we follow and enforce a [code of conduct](http://thestrangeloop.com/policies.html), to which all present at the conference are expected to adhere.

3. Community, not marketing.
   We don't give the attendee list to any sponsors.

4. Blind auditions.
   Talks are selected anonymously by a diverse talk selection committee.
