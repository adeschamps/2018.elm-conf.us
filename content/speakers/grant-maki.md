## Grant's Talk: *Facilitating technology change through cultural change*

When we discuss how to help teams adopt new technologies or paradigms like Elm of Functional Programming, we often focus on a technical glide path. Not enough attention is given to building a team culture that is open to experimenting with new technologies and adopting them if the experiments go well. This talk will explore strategies and tactics to build such a culture through the lens of my teamâ€™s experiences at a large, well-known company that is not in the software industry. Building such a culture has produced a number of pleasant side effect, including allowing our team to adopt Elm for all of our front-end development.
