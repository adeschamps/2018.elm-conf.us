## Anthony's talk: *Programming Robots with Elm*

Elm is most often used to make webapps, but it's a great language for other domains as well. Using ports and the actor model, we can embed Elm in another environment&mdash;whether it's a larger application or just a thin layer of glue code.

In this talk we will learn how to use Elm to program a robot. This will involve both imperative and functional programming, and play to the strengths of each of them.
