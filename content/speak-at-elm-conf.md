# Speak at elm-conf

The elm-conf CFP (call for proposals) is open from April 9th through May 13th.

The quick facts:

- You can submit as many talks as you like, but we'll pick at most one.
- Your talk will be reviewed anonymously by a small group (see "Anonymity" below.)
- We're happy to give you feedback on your ideas before before you send them in: email [elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com](mailto:elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com).
- If we accept your talk, we'll:
  - fly you to St. Louis ($TODO stipend for speakers coming from outside the USA)
  - book you a hotel room close to the venue for the duration of the conference
  - give you a ticket to elm-conf and Strange Loop
  - work with you to make a great talk
  - invite you to a speakers dinner prior to the conference

## Submitting a Talk

TODO link to the CFP site.

## First-time Speakers

We are reserving several spots for first-time speakers this year.

## Talk Formats

All talks are 30 minutes long. (TODO except keynotes?)

While we will consider all talks, we're specifically looking for:

- TODO

That said, the best elm-conf talks are a mix of practical and philosophical&mdash;if your proposal tells us both *what* and *why*, we'll be very happy to see your proposal.

If you need further inspiration, the talks from [2016](TODO) and [2017](TODO) are available online.

## How Anonymous Proposals Work

The first pass of talk evaluation is done anonymously by a group of Elm community members and external observers.
We do this to give everyone the fairest shot possible at being accepted, and to avoid picking the same speakers every year.
We've had a lot of success with this; it's given us a nice mix of veteran and first-time speakers on tons of great topics over the years.

That said, we recognize that any process involving humans will be imperfect.
The Elm community is fairly small and sometimes it's impossible to avoid putting identifying information in a proposal.
If you find yourself in that situation, focus on making a *high-quality* proposal over an *anonymized* one.
We lean on the committee members outside the Elm community here; they can give these proposals the fairest shot.
