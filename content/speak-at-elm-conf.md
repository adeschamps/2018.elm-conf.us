# Speak at elm-conf

The elm-conf call for speakers is open from April 9th through May 13th.

The quick facts:

- You can submit as many talks as you like, but we'll pick at most one.
- Your talk will be reviewed anonymously by a small group (see "Anonymity" below.)
- We're happy to give you feedback on your ideas before before you send them in: [email elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com](mailto:elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com).
- If we accept your talk, we'll:
  - fly you to St. Louis ($TODO stipend for speakers coming from outside the USA)
  - book you a hotel room close to the venue for the duration of the conference
  - give you a ticket to elm-conf and Strange Loop
  - work with you to make a great talk
  - invite you to a speakers dinner prior to the conference

## Talk Formats

All talks are 30 minutes long. (TODO except keynotes?)

While we will consider all talks, we're specifically looking for:

- TODO

That said, the best elm-conf talks are a mix of practical and philosophical&mdash;we'll be happy to see any proposal that tells us both *what* and *why*.

If you need further inspiration, the talks from [2016](TODO) and [2017](TODO) are available onlineg.

## Submitting a Talk

TODO link to the CFP site.

## First-time Speakers

If you're a first time conference speaker, you still have a really good shot of getting in.
We believe that first-time speakers have a unique perspective on both Elm and conference talks, and should be encouraged to speak up!

In fact, we are reserving several spots for first-time speakers.
Our community gets stronger the more new and diverse voices there are, and this is part of our efforts to make that happen.
If this is you, please indicate so on the CFP form!

Once accepted, we will help you give your first conference talk.
This includes talk structure, practice sessions, and access to more experienced speakers to talk about about what works well.

You will also be invited to the speaker dinner.
We encourage you to attend this; it's a nice time to get to know your fellow speakers better.

We will also make sure you get a chance to become familiar with the venue before the audience is there&mdash;this helps calm jitters more than you'd think!

If you have any other questions about this, please [email us](mailto:elm-conf@thestrangeloop.com)!

## How Anonymous Proposals Work

The first pass of talk evaluation is done anonymously by a group of Elm community members and external observers.
We do this to give everyone the fairest shot possible at being accepted, and to avoid picking the same speakers every year.
We've had a lot of success with this; it's given us a nice mix of veteran and first-time speakers on tons of great topics over the years.

That said, we recognize that any process involving humans will be imperfect.
The Elm community is fairly small and sometimes it's impossible to avoid putting identifying information in a proposal.
If you find yourself in that situation, focus on making a *high-quality* proposal over an *anonymized* one.
We lean on the committee members outside the Elm community here; they can give these proposals the fairest shot.
