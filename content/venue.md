elm-conf will be taking place on September 26 at the historic Peabody Opera house in St. Louis, MO.
We are returning as a Strange Loop pre-conference event, and attendees are welcome at the Strange Loop party at City Museum during the evening of the 26th.
We encourage you to attend Strange Loop as well as elm-conf.
If you like one you'll probably like the other!

## Dress Code

elm-conf not specify a formal dress code.
Wear whatever you're comfortable with as long as it does not violate the [code of conduct](https://thestrangeloop.com/policies.html).

If you're a first-time conference-goer and nervous about what to wear, [business casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_casual) is a safe bet.
In past years, people have dressed in a wide range from [casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual) to business casual.
