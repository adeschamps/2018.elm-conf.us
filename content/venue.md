elm-conf will be taking place on September 26 at the historic Peabody Opera house in St. Louis, MO.
We are returning as a Strange Loop pre-conference event, and attendees are welcome at the Strange Loop party at City Museum during the evening of the 26th.
We encourage you to attend Strange Loop as well as elm-conf.
If you like one you'll probably like the other!

## Flying In

[St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL)](https://www.flystl.com/flights-and-airlines/airlines) is the closest airport to the venue.

For domestic travel, Southwest Airlines has nonstop flights to St. Louis from many cities in the United States.

For international travel, most carriers will go through immigration and customs at Chicago O'Hare with a connection to St. Louis. WOW air recently opened connecting flights through Reykjavik, if that's more convenient for you.

From the airport, here are some ways you can to the hotels and conference venue:

| How? | Cost | Extra Information |
|:-|-:|:-|
| Metrolink Train | $3 | Get off at the Union Station Stop |
| Lyft | $28-37 | Get updated estimates at [Lyft's Fare Estimator](https://www.lyft.com/fare-estimate) |
| Taxi | ~$40 | |

Hotel stays can be booked in the Strange Loop blocks at Union Station (~10min walk) or the Ballpark Hilton (~15 minute walk.) See [Strange Loops Hotel Page](https://thestrangeloop.com/register.html) for more details.

## Dress Code

elm-conf not specify a formal dress code.
Wear whatever you're comfortable with as long as it does not violate the [code of conduct](https://thestrangeloop.com/policies.html).

If you're a first-time conference-goer and nervous about what to wear, [business casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_casual) is a safe bet.
In past years, people have dressed in a wide range from [casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual) to business casual.
