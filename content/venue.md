elm-conf will be taking place on September 26 at the historic Peabody Opera house in St. Louis, MO.
We are returning as a Strange Loop pre-conference event, and attendees are welcome at the Strange Loop party at City Museum during the evening of the 26th.
We encourage you to attend Strange Loop as well as elm-conf.
If you like one you'll probably like the other!

## Getting (and Staying) There

Lambert-St. Louis International Airport (STL) is the closest airport to the venue, and you can take a metrolink train ($3, Union Station stop), Lyft (~$35), or taxi (~$40) downtown.

Hotel stays can be booked in the Strange Loop blocks at Union Station (~10min walk) or the Ballpark Hilton (~15 minute walk.) See Strange Loops Hotel Page for more details.
